Care Home Dataset template: https://ckm.apperta.org/ckm/templates/1051.57.273

Based on the care home data inventory described in a recent paper by Lucy Johnston et al from Edinburgh Napier University, which is available here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176503v2 

The original data inventory is shown below, along with another care home dataset that we have used as an example in our data models.
